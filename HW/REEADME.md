# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

The data represents earthquakes in the last seven days that is updated from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using Leaflet to plot the data. 

A screenshot of the visualization is displayed below. Red circles indicate a greater magnitude of earthquake. After reviewing this data, I have decided not to move to Eureka. Ever.
