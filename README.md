# Visualizing-Data-with-Leaflet

- The data represents earthquakes in the last seven days that is updated from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using Leaflet to plot the data. 

- A screenshot of the visualization is displayed below. Red circles indicate an earthquake of a greater magnitude. After reviewing this data, I have decided not to move to Eureka. Ever.
